## Introduction
Danny wants to expand his Pizza Empire so he decided to Uberize it! He then hired "runners" to deliver pizza from his headquarters and understands that data collection is crucial in expanding his business. He now needs help understanding this data and see how he can best leverage it to grow his empire.

Here we can see that 2 columns in the customer_orders table need cleaning. To standardize, I will replace blank and 'null' values with NULL. 
```
SELECT order_id,
	customer_id,
	pizza_id,
	CASE WHEN exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL
	ELSE NULLIF(exclusions,'')
	END exclusions,
	CASE WHEN extras = 'null' THEN NULL
	ELSE NULLIF(extras,'')
	END extras,
	order_time
FROM customer_orders;
```
