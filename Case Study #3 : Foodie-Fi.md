## Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny wants to launch a new streaming service with only food-related content. Think Netflix but only cooking shows! 

He started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving customers unlimited access to food videos around the world. Danny wants to use this case study to understand the data and influence future decisions on investment and new features.

## Business Questions
### Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

#### Sample subscriptions table

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
  s.plan_id,
  s.start_date,
  p.plan_name
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date;
```

**Result**

- 1 out of 8 customers (Customer 11) or 12.5% of the total sample subscriptions decided not to continue the subscription after the trial period.
- 3 out of 8 customers (Customer 1, 13, 16) or 37.5% of the total sample subscriptions decided to downgrade and start with the basic monthly plan. 2 out of 3 customers were successfully converted to a pro plan. However, the start dates of these pro plans were way past the monthly renewal date therefore it is important to note that as per the upgrade policy, higher plans will automatically take effect which means that the customers paid for the basic plan and the pro plan in 1 month.

- 3 out of 8 customers (Customer 2, 18, 19) or 37.5% of the total sample subscriptions were automatically entered in the pro monthly plan after their trial period. 1 out of 3 customers converted to an annual plan on the same day of the pro monthly plan's renewal date.
- 1 out of 8 customers (Customer 2) immediately upgraded his plan to pro annual after the trial period.
 
### Data Analysis Questions
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
   ```sql
   SELECT
     COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) customer_cnt
   FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
   ```

   **Result**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a301742c-849c-4485-955b-024424aa94c2)

   - Foodie-Fi has a total of 1,000 customers since it started.

2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
   ```sql
   SELECT
     DATE_TRUNC('month',start_date) month_start,
     COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) customer_cnt
   FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
   WHERE plan_id = 0
   GROUP BY month_start
   ORDER BY month_start
   ```

   **Result**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a755cb3-83a5-4569-acb0-02bce9a13718)

   - March had the highest number of trial subscriptions with February being the lowest (less number of days in February potentially affected this number)
     
3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
   ```sql
   SELECT
     s.plan_id,
     p.plan_name,
     count(s.customer_id) customer_cnt
   FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
   JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
   WHERE s.start_date >= '2021-01-01'
   GROUP BY s.plan_id, p.plan_name
   ORDER BY plan_id
   ```

   **Result**
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f9f8f32-36ec-4761-a979-3a3ab1ec1473)

   - As observed in the result, there is a high churn count of customers after 2021. 

4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) churn_customers,
   ROUND(
       SUM(
         CASE WHEN p.plan_name = 'churn' THEN 1
         ELSE 0 END)::decimal(10,2)
   /COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)*100,1) as churn_rate
   FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
   JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
   ```

   **Result**

      p.plan_name,
      LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) next_plan
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    )
    SELECT
      SUM(
        CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND next_plan = 'churn' THEN 1
        ELSE 0 END) churn_after_trial,
    ROUND(
        SUM(
          CASE WHEN plan_name = 'trial' AND next_plan = 'churn'
          THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::decimal(10,2)
      /COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)*100,0) as churn_after_trial_percentage
    FROM churn

    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
    JOIN foodie_fi.plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE p.plan_name IN ('pro monthly','basic monthly')
    AND date_part('year',start_date) = 2020
    ORDER BY s.customer_id
    )
    SELECT COUNT(customer_id)
    	FROM downgrade
    WHERE downgrade = 'basic monthly'
    ```

    **Result**
    - in 2020, there were no customers who downgraded from pro monthly to basic monthly

### Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

### Outside The Box Questions
The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
